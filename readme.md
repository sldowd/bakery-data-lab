# 🧁 Bakery Data Lab

A companion data science project to the `bakery-manager` CLI app. This lab explores real-world analytics, trends, and predictions using transaction and inventory data collected by the bakery system.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Analyze bakery inventory and transactions with Python & pandas
- Visualize trends using matplotlib and seaborn
- Forecast inventory depletion and sales using basic ML
- Build interactive or exportable reports for the team

---

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python 3 (via Anaconda)
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- SQLite (using data from bakery-manager)

Optional:
- scikit-learn for regression or classification
- streamlit for interactive dashboards

---

## 📁 Project Structure
```bash
bakery-data-lab/
├── notebooks/
│   └── transactions_analysis.ipynb
├── data/
│   └── bakery.db  # or CSV exports from bakery-manager
├── scripts/
│   └── connect_sqlite.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt  (optional for pip)
```

---

## 🏁 Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Open a Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Run `transactions_analysis.ipynb` to explore sales + expenses

You can also use:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

---

## 💡 Data Source
This lab uses data generated by the `bakery-manager` Rust application:
- Inventory (`inventory` table)
- Transactions (`transactions` table)
- Recipes and usage (optional in advanced stages)

You can export the SQLite file or write a Rust function to output CSVs for easier import.

---

## 📊 Example Questions We’ll Answer
- What are my top-selling items?
- Which ingredients are depleting the fastest?
- When should I reorder butter?
- What’s the rolling 7-day revenue?

---

## 📈 Next Steps
- Add more notebooks to the `/notebooks` folder
- Link with your `bakery-manager` project for real-time analysis
- Build a streamlit dashboard version
